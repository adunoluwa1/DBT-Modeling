# dbt Modelling Showcase
This repository is dedicated to showcasing my **dbt (data build tool)** modelling skills. The projects within are designed to demonstrate a deep understanding of data transformation, data quality, and best practices in building robust, scalable data pipelines.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a portfolio of my work. It highlights my ability to:

- Structure data projects for maintainability and collaboration.

- Build complex data models using SQL, following a layered approach.

- Implement data quality checks to ensure data reliability and accuracy.

- Generate comprehensive documentation to make data assets understandable to all stakeholders.

- Optimize models for performance in a production environment.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized to follow standard dbt project layouts, with a dedicated folder for each project.

```

Each project folder contains its own `README.md` file with specific documentation for that project. The root `README.md` provides an overview of the entire repository.

# Projects
- **E-commerce Data Modelling**: This project demonstrates the transformation of raw e-commerce data into a clean, business-ready data mart. It includes a layered approach with staging models, intermediate transformations, and final data marts for customer and product analytics. The project features extensive data quality tests and documentation.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation within each project folder.
